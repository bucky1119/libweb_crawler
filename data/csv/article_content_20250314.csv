It then becomes undetectable by the tests commonly used in the food industry and hospitals, thus representing a major health risk. Scientists at INRAE, in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur, have discovered the mechanisms behind this dormancy and have developed a specific detection method. These results, published in Nature Communications, shed new light on bacterial dormancy and open up prospects for better management of health risks."

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 aims to reduce food losses and waste, with a specific goal of cutting them by half at the retail and consumer levels by 2030. European and international initiatives are striving to identify and tackle food loss and waste “hot spots”, monitor changes over time and evaluate public policies. To support such efforts, a study has explored the dynamics in France of a “new link” to connect institutional catering and food aid organizations to redistribute food surpluses."

The result may be permanent axial movement of the pipeline, which puts stress on the structural members connected to it, and which must be appropriately engineered to avoid compromising the project. One approach to mitigating this pipeline ‘walking’ is the use a pipe-clamping mattress (PCM). Over the last year, the NGCF team have studied the behaviour of PCMs for three different offshore soil types, focusing on their ability to provide high restraint against walking over the operating life of a subsea pipeline. The outcomes of this research are being used in practice, with the objective to reduce cost without compromising performance."

Getting a grip on offshore pipelines			,Scott Mitchell,T0,西澳大学,澳大利亚,2020-09-22,https://researchimpact.uwa.edu.au/research-impact-stories/getting-grip-offshore-pipeline-design/,F0,AG0,"As offshore gas production facilities are turned on and off, the pipelines connecting the facility to the reservoir expand and contract. The result may be permanent axial movement of the pipeline, which puts stress on the structural members connected to it, and which must be appropriately engineered to avoid compromising the project. One approach to mitigating this pipeline ‘walking’ is the use a pipe-clamping mattress (PCM). Over the last year, the NGCF team have studied the behaviour of PCMs for three different offshore soil types, focusing on their ability to provide high restraint against walking over the operating life of a subsea pipeline. The outcomes of this research are being used in practice, with the objective to reduce cost without compromising performance."

Through his work with UNESCO, Professor Winter is developing a database that will give countries along the Belt and Road insight around issues of development, tourist growth in the region, maintaining cultural heritage and for UNESCO the database will potentially also serve as a platform for world heritage nominations.

Australia produces around 2.25 million tonnes of pulses annually. However, changes in the production environment such as climate, new pests, water shortages and higher farming costs requires pulse breeders to have better strategies to ensure crops can adapt to changing conditions. Dr Janine Croser and her team at UWA have developed the aSSD platform. The platform speeds the development of pure lines for plant breeders; with improved crop quality, predictability and resilience of offspring in harsh climate conditions for farmers as well as better quality food for consumers.
